  “Because, you know, resilience - if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush,
  then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would
  be gone. But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget.
  Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.” Jeff
  Bezos
