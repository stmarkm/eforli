  “We are at our very best, and we are happiest, when we are fully engaged in
  work we enjoy on the journey toward the goal we've established for ourselves.
  It gives meaning to our time off and comfort to our sleep. It makes everything
  else in life so wonderful, so worthwhile.” Earl Nightingale
