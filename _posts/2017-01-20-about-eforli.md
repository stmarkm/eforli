# About eforli
![sharing ideas on: sustaining confidence... supporting incomes... helping us all to thrive...](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8dc2e478-a961-4d68-be2a-d55c5d909468.jpg)

Sharing ideas on how each of us can:

* sustain our own and our teams confidence
* how we can help business and society with supporting incomes for each of us 
* how we can help each other thrive

There is so much challenge in our world, so much division, and yet so much potential. The reality of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, the pressure on traditional jobs, the backlash on globalisation are just a few.

eforli.com is looking to share great content, develop ideas, and look at opportunities that we can take to rebuild confidence and get back to progress as a whole world, not a divided one.
