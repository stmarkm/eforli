  “It's like Forrest Gump said, 'Life is like a box of chocolates.' Your career
  is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going to get. But
  everything you get is going to teach you something along the way and make you
  the person you are today. That's the exciting part - it's an adventure in
  itself.” Nick Carter
