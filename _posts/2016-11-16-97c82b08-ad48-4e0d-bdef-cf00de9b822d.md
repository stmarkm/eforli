  “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be
  truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to
  do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep
  looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you
  find it.” Steve Jobs
